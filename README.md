# My Fortran generator WS2nanotubes inputs for my paper 

## CLOSED

I DECLARE THAT THIS CODE WAS ORIGINALLY WROTE BY Jin-Wu Jiang, jwjiang5918@hotmail.com; jiangjinwu@shu.edu.cn. 
I modified these codes so we can get deffects on the tube. 
I share some of my inputs in order to make a tension simulation on nanotubes on the axial axis.

These inputs are for lammps, a software used in Molecular Dynamics.
You need to adjust some parameters if you change the nanotube.
